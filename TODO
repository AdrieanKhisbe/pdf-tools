** Merge duplicate code
* Isearch
** Allow for entering multibyte characters with some input-methods.
   The PDF buffer is in unibyte mode prohibiting the user from
   inserting multibyte characters in the minibuffer with some
   input-methods, while editing the search string.
** Implement alternative rendering method
   The advantage of the method is more accurate highlighting.  The
   default method sometimes highlights to much text, but it looks
   prettier.
   + Use renderpage-regions instead of renderpage-text-regions
   + Define appropriate faces
   + Provide customizable alpha values
   + Define a minor-mode for it
   + Use minor-mode to decide rendering method
* PDF Forms
  Recent poppler versions have some support for editing forms.
