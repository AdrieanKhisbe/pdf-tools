* epdfinfo
** Provide some basic cairo rendering operations
   This could be useful for example when displaying annotations as
   selected.  (This looks pretty ugly at the moment.)
* pdf-isearch
** Allow for entering multibyte characters with some input-methods.
   The PDF buffer is in unibyte mode prohibiting the user from
   inserting multibyte characters in the minibuffer with some
   input-methods, while editing the search string.
** Implement alternative rendering method
   The default method sometimes highlights to much text, though it
   looks pretty.
* pdf-view
** DONE Extended regions
   Support extended selections, where multiple regions are active.  May
   be usefull for text-markup annotations.
* PDF Forms
  Recent poppler versions have some support for editing forms.
