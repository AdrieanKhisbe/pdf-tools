* pdf-isearch
** Allow for entering multibyte characters with some input-methods.
   The PDF buffer is in unibyte mode prohibiting the user from
   inserting multibyte characters in the minibuffer with some
   input-methods, while editing the search string.
** Implement regexp search
   + Use pdf-info-search-regexp if isearch-regexp is non-nil.
   + Make search-regexp use glib's regexp function. 
   + Make functions handle a list of edges per match.
* pdf-occur
** Implement regexp search
* PDF Forms
  Recent poppler versions have some support for editing forms.
* pdf-annot
** Updating the list buffer is too slow
   + Update it incrementally.
   + Possibly skip the update if the buffer is not visible.
** Make highlighting customizable
* epdfinfo
** Maybe split the code up in several files.
* pdf-view
** Provide some kind of multipage view  
** Make persisten scrolling relative
   Currently the scrolling is kept when changing the image's size (in
   pdf-view-display-image), which is actually not so desirable, since
   it is absolute.  This results e.g. in the image popping out of the
   window, when it is shrunken.
** Fix resizing issues
*** window parameter pdf-view-window-size
    There is currently no check whether the window changed buffer in
    pdf-view-maybe-redisplay-resized-windows.
* pdf-info
** Add a report/debug command, displaying a list of open files and other information.
