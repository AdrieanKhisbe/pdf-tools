* Version 0.40
  I basically reimplemented the whole thing. (Not really, but a lot
  has changed.)
** Displaying PDF Files.
   Rendering is now done almost completely in libpoppler (no convert
   anymore), while PNG images are kept in memory and files are solely
   used as a means of exchange between Emacs and epdfinfo.  In
   essence, display should be much faster.
*** New Major Mode pdf-view
    Hacking up doc-view.el to support a server-based ,,rendering
    engine'' would have been to awkward. So a new major-mode was
    needed : pdf-view-mode . Both are very similar regarding
    user-interface.  Some differences are:
    + Setting the width to `fit-width', `fit-height' or `fit-page'
      keeps up with window-size changes.
    + The values of the slice are relative, i.e. independant of the
      image-size.
*** PNG Image Cache
    Image data is cached, in order to keep the time it needs to
    display a page low.  Some pages are preloaded for the same reason,
    while idleing.  The number of cached images per buffer may be
    customized using `pdf-cache-image-limit'.
** Annotations
*** New supported types
    Provided epdfinfo was build with a recent version of libpoppler,
    you may now create and modify the following markup annotation
    types: highlight, squiggly, underline and strike-out.
** Various
*** You may now select extended regions with C-mouse-1.
*** Numerous other changes
